### Start here

The [Which bikes are racy/rowdy/relaxed?](qmd/gravel_ternary.qmd) page contains an interactive, ternary plot for all gravel bike models in the database. Click on the points for finding bikes in the style you're seeking.

```{r echo=FALSE}
image_folder <- "images"
image_file <- "gravel-ternary.png"
image_path <- here(image_folder, image_file)
include_graphics(image_path)
```

### A little deeper

The [What makes a rowdy frame rowdy?](qmd/what_makes_a_rowdy_bike_rowdy.qmd) and [What makes a relaxed frame relaxed?](qmd/what_makes_a_relaxed_bike_relaxed.qmd) pages are full of plots showing which frame measures are most correlated with a style, and which aren't.

### Into the weeds

The [Gravel 2D](qmd/gravel_scatter.qmd) page contains interactive, 2D scatter plots of different pairs of frame geometry measures for all gravel bike models and frame sizes in the database.

```{r echo=FALSE}
image_folder <- "images"
image_file <- "gravel-scatter.png"
image_path <- here(image_folder, image_file)
include_graphics(image_path)
```

### A view from afar

The [What is Gravel Style?](qmd/what_is_a_gravel_bike.qmd) page compares gravel bikes in the database to Road Race, Road Endurance, Cyclocross, and XC Mountain bikes.

```{r echo=FALSE}
image_folder <- "images"
image_file <- "gravel-style.png"
image_path <- here(image_folder, image_file)
include_graphics(image_path)
```

### The classification

The [Gravel Tree](qmd/gravel_tree.qmd) page contains a tree diagram showing the relative similarity in frame geometry among all gravel bikes in the database and the clustering of the models into three major styles.

```{r echo=FALSE}
image_folder <- "images"
image_file <- "gravel-tree-1.png"
image_path <- here(image_folder, image_file)
include_graphics(image_path)
```

The [Gravel Table](qmd/gravel_class.qmd) page contains a table of the classification of all gravel bike models in the database into All-road, Endurance, and Trail categories.

```{r echo=FALSE}
image_folder <- "images"
image_file <- "gravel-table.png"
image_path <- here(image_folder, image_file)
include_graphics(image_path)
```
